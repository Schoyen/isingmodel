# Ising model

This project uses Metropolis sampling to compute the Ising model.

## Installation
Currently we only use a "local installation" by compiling the source code into a
shared library which we output the directory `notebooks/` along with the
notebook.  To do this run:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext
```
